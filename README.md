# Animal Kingdom (Internship selection task)

Web app is live on: https://animalkingdom-app.herokuapp.com/

## Available Scripts

If you want to run in your local machine, you can run:

To install node files:

### `npm install`

To run project:

### `npm start`


## Explanation:

First, I created json-server to work with data in json file as a api as db.json file.
It automatically handles all requests and creates easy to use API.

Json Server is live on: https://animalkingdom-app.herokuapp.com/animals

Second, I developed web app using Reactjs and CSS, Material UI tool for designing.

In app: you can View, Create, Update, Delete, Search, Like and Share animal posts. 

When you click share icon, it copies current animal url to clipboard and notifies you.

If any of image url is not valid, system automatically sets 404 error dog image when displaying, but in database it remains itself.
System doesn't let you add or update posts if there is any empty text field.


Enjoy!
